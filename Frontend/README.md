## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript with modern, responsive design
- **Backend**: Flask web server
- **Search**: Pinecone vector database for semantic search
- **Storage**: Supabase for article metadata and content

### API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Main search interface
- `POST /search` - Search endpoint (accepts JSON with `query` and optional `top_k`)
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint

### Environment Variables

The application uses the same environment variables as your Embedding system:
- `PINECONE_API_KEY`
- `PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT`
- `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME`
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Module not found" errors:**
   - Make sure you're in the `Frontend` directory
   - Ensure the `Embedding` directory is accessible
   - Check that all requirements are installed

2. **"Search failed" errors:**
   - Verify your `.env` file has correct credentials
   - Check that Pinecone and Supabase are accessible
   - Ensure you have articles in your database

3. **No search results:**
   - Try different search terms
   - Check that articles have been processed and stored
   - Verify the search query isn't too specific

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the terminal output for error messages
2. Verify your environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure your database has articles to search through

## Customization

### Styling
The interface uses CSS custom properties and can be easily customized by modifying the styles in `templates/index.html`.

### Search Parameters
You can adjust search behavior by modifying the `top_k` parameter in the JavaScript code (currently set to 20 results).

### Adding Features
The Flask app structure makes it easy to add new features like:
- Search filters
