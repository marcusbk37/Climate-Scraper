What is MVP of this scraper that I can demo Tuesday (ideally earlier)?
- Needs to have some intake - needs to be able to take in google sheet. I can do this manually
** did this, great job **

- Needs to have a basic front end - a simple webpage where you put in a query,
it calls the backend with that query, and then displays the top (10) articles
(so basically has an input to call the pipeline I set up and shows the results)




now, gotta get the scraper working to get interesting content...
- where can I get useful content from? google probably isn't valuable...

What am I doing about duplicate articles? Because that could be problematic...
- right now, if url is same don't store
- in the future, want to add a way to update content that exists
