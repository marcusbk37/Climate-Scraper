setup + put in pinecone stuff
setup + put in openAI stuff (and load a bit of money in)
- Does pinecone do it themselves? I think they might - they said I only have to work with text........
*** this would be awesome... ***

get a bit of test data to try stuff
    - put into supabase (in database.py)
    - go from supabase to pinecone (embed) (in embedding.py)
    - filter for the chunks I want (in embedding.py)
    - use what is retrieved to get the full articles (in database.py)

# last note as of Monday night - getting stuck on chunking (trying to work on buffer after end of sentence, isn't working atm)
- might be good to start from scratch-ish and write my own logic...
