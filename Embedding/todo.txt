Soon To-Do
- Put in scoring mechanism
        % of top result (for comparison) and % match
- Clean up front end to expand view of an article
** after these, send out to the team **

- Tag field in supabase for different sources (eg. company vs. research paper)?
- Put in Nate's sheet
- Research API
- Daily newsletters







What is MVP of this scraper that I can demo Tuesday (ideally earlier)?
- Needs to have some intake - needs to be able to take in google sheet. I can do this manually
** did this, great job **

- Needs to have a basic front end - a simple webpage where you put in a query,
it calls the backend with that query, and then displays the top (10) articles
(so basically has an input to call the pipeline I set up and shows the results)
** did this, great job **

Now, need to deploy frontend. Might need to change env vars and RLS in supabase?



now, gotta get the scraper working to get interesting content...
- where can I get useful content from? google probably isn't valuable...

What am I doing about duplicate articles? Because that could be problematic...
- right now, if url is same don't store
- in the future, want to add a way to update content that exists

Do want to ultimately put in a score and a % match. But for now not necessary


From Meeting
- Put in score and match %. 
- A few more frontend things to clean up (eg. can click and expand, can see stuff more cleanly)
- Figure out how to tag and format the data more cleanly...

- Broaden info intake (Nate's sheet, Stanford sources)
    Cass's thoughts on how to automate - gmail plugin API,
    ex-Googler who wrote chrome extension to manipulate the DOM (doing it from the HTML)
    Spok has capability where you can connect inbox to Spok and show all conversations

Reach out to Thomas re. MIT startups

    Public sources:
        TomKat website
        Research papers (but have to filter through the noise - reputable institutions)
            Archive has an API (easiest to filter) - Cass likes this
        What if you dump out pitchbooks?
        Daily newsletters (CTVC, Daily VC, NextPlay?). Might be an RSS feed (so wouldn't have to scrape email)
