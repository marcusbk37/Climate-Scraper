finish setup for supabase

get a bit of test data to try stuff
    - put into supabase (in database.py)
    - go from supabase to pinecone (embed) (in embedding.py) - this function works
    - filter for the chunks I want (in embedding.py) - this function works
    - use what is retrieved to get the full articles (in database.py)

What am I doing about duplicate articles? Because that could be problematic...
- right now, if url is same don't store
- in the future, want to add a way to update content that exists
